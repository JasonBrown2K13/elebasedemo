**Mobile**
Not tested on any mobile devices. It's important to note that this prototype was never run as a live demo in any presentation. It was only seen in a 70 second video embedded in a presentation that was presented on Thursday 25th January 2018. 

Not compatible with Internet Explorer.

## Known bugs

Browser scaling does not apply to the menu buttons correctly which do not resize to fit the page correctly when the prototype is running in a smaller browser window. 

The page does not display correctly in any version of Internet Explorer due to the way that FlexBox (a crtitical component of the Bulma CSS framework) is rendered.
